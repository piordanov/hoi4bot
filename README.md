## HOI4 Server Bot

This is a simple bot for discord, with attempts at setting reminders for our eu4 games and a few meme-related functions. To set up your own bot, follow instructions in this [tutorial](https://medium.com/renemari-padillo/tutorial-creating-a-simple-discord-bot-9465a2764dc0)
 to create your own bot, or you can make your app [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) and make your own `auth.json` file as so:
```
{
    "token": "YOUR TOKEN HERE"
}
 ```
For some tutorials on writing a bot with discord.js, I would look at the [docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome)
 as well as this [guide](https://anidiotsguide.gitbooks.io/discord-js-bot-guide/).
